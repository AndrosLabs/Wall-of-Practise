# Wall of Practise

This Repo is part of a 21 days course spread across 3 weeks teaching:

- Git & GitHub
- VS Code Tricks
- Linux Terminal

## Practise Problem

Here are some assignments that you might find interesting and should be easy:

1. Create a Branch & commit something you wanna share something publicaly, maybe that famous quote you saw right now in a book or a link to your favourite movie, song or that amazing art you saw. GitHub isn't just a place for code but anything that you want. 

Create a new folder under your intials(Choose a pseudo name) and then share your piece of work and then create a pull request in this repo

2. I hve left some typo in this README.md, why don't you try fixing thm?

3. Try Reading the commmit history to see what changes have been introduced in this Repo.

4. Try to improve this Repo by rewriting the above sentences.

### Caution

I have tried to create this repo as a sorta an assignments and I will keep updating it whenever I come up with new ideas.

I am no expert and I am not claiming that my commit messages, documentation style are the standard one as I too am learning just like you.
